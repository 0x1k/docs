# Contribute to the Kadena Docs

How to contribute to the docs from docs.kadena.io, GitHub, or a local environment.

---

The Kadena documentation is open source and hosted on GitHub. Using our public-facing [Docs](https://github.com/kadena-community/docs) repo in the [Kadena Community GitHub](https://github.com/kadena-community), you can make suggested changes using pull requests. This allows community members to improve the documentation and helps improve the Kadena developer experience.

There are 3 ways to contribute to the Docs depending on where you are starting from.

- From the Docs
- From GitHub
- From a Local Environment.

This article goes over each of these options to help you suggest changes to the [Kadena Docs](https://github.com/kadena-community/docs).
